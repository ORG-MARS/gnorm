Gnorm uses go templates you write to convert database schemas into code (or
other text) that you can use.  To learn more about using go templates, [read the
documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

There are three templates that gnorm uses to generate code: 

- schema.tpl - used to generate code per database schema
- table.tpl - used to generate code per table
- enum.tpl - used to generate code per database enum

By default, these templates are expected to be in the directory where gnorm is
run, but you can configure the directory by setting TemplateDir in your
[gnorm.toml](/cli/configuration).

The names of the files that are created by these templates are controlled by the
values of SchemaPath, TablePath, and EnumPath in your configuration.  For each
schema, table, and enum in your database, the appropriate portion of the schema
is passed to the appropriate template and saved to the file based on the path
template. Thus, you must ensure that the names of the files generated by the
path templates are unique based on the names of the data in the schema.
